# Case Study : Analyze and create visualizations on an orange juice sales dataset



# Project Description

Susan is a Manager of a store that sells multiple juice brands. She wants to develop a performance dashboard. Attached is that sample dataset sheâ€™s taken a from the past. The sample data contains weekly volume of sales for orange juice, and information about how much was spent on advertisements, television, temperature, petrol prices etc

She has an annual conference coming up in less than a week to prepare for, but wanted to get this started without delay. She jotted down a few bullets to convey what she has in mind for the dashboard**

The dashboard should have 3 tabs.

I want the first tab to show how the Orange Juice Sales (Both in Gallons as well as Revenue) across time. There has to be two graphs in this tab. o One should show the sales trend for the entire time period, and I should be able to collapse or expand to see yearly, quarterly, monthly or weekly. o The other chart should show the trends of 52 weeks, and have one line per year. On this graph, I should have a filter to select just one year, or multiple years.

In the second tab, I would like to see how Orange Juice Sales (Gallons) change in relation to factors which we can control (like prices, advertisement spend, promotions, TV etc.). Each graph in this tab can either be X-Y type charts, or show how both variables vary across time. I should have filters to select one or multiple years

In the final tab, I would like to see how the Orange Juice Sales (Gallons) change in relation to the factors outside control (temperature, petrol prices, holidays etc.). Each graph in this tab can either be X-Y type charts, or show how both variables vary across time. I should have filters to select one or multiple years
